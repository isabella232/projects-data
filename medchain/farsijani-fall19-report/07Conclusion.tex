In this project, we designed and implemented a distributed authorization and access management system for medical queries called Medchain. Medchain is written in Go and is based on an existing distributed framework called Cothority and runs on conodes. It enables distributed access management through the use of smart contracts (Darcs) and offers auditability through the use of permissioned blockchains for recording all the queries it receives over its lifetime. Medchain is mainly designed to work seamlessly with MedCo and overcome MedCo's authorization limitations.

Medchain supports a CLI interface that enables the user to interact with the cluster of servers through the command-line. In future versions of Medchain, we aim to integrate it with MedCo ecosystem and have it work as part of the whole MedCo workflow. We will also improve its front-end and the user interface.
