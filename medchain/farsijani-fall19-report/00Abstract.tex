\begin{abstract}

There is great body of research that depends on use and analysis of clinical and health data as well as sharing them among multiple institutions in some way. This gives rise to some concerns and issues regarding the privacy of data owners due to researchers' access to such sensitive data. A number of software solutions have been developed in order to address this problem and allow privacy-preserving analysis and sharing of sensitive medical data among many institutions such as MedCo \cite{raisaro2018medco}, being the very first operational one. However, when it comes to authentication and authorization of data users, MedCo exhibits some limitations. First, in MedCo, authentication and authorization are central which introduces a single point of failure within the network. Second, each participant in MedCo cluster, runs its own access management process.  

In this project, we propose ``Medchain: a distributed authorization and authentication system for medical queries" that overcomes the drawbacks present in MedCo. Medchain works seamlessly with MedCo and complements its full workflow by handling the access management. Furthermore, Medchain offers auditability as it records all the medical queries from the users in an immutable ledger, i.e., blockchain.
