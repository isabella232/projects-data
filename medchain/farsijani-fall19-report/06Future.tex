In this section, we would like to offer some opportunities for further improving our implemented software solution and the results of this project. 

\subsection{Integration with MedCo}
One of the main purposes and requirements of Medchain is to make it work seamlessly with data service providers, specifically MedCo. However, given that this requirement was not fulfilled in the scope of this project, the full integration of Medchain into MedCo is expected to be done in future versions of Medchain.  

\subsection{Use of Deferred Transactions}
Although we were able to implement deferred transactions in Medchain, we have not been able to test their functionality in this project and we are not sure if they function properly as we have only tested this functionality locally. Therefore, it is expected that in the future this functionality will be tested in a multi-node setup and debugged if necessary.
