There is great body of research that depends on use and analysis of clinical and health data as well as sharing them among multiple institutions in some way. This gives rise to some concerns and issues regarding the privacy of data. A number of software solutions have been developed in order to address this problem and allow privacy-preserving analysis and sharing of sensitive medical data such as MedCo \cite{raisaro2018medco}, being the very first operational one. However, when it comes to authentication and authorization of data users, MedCo exhibits some limitations. First, in MedCo, both authentication and authorization are central which introduces a single point of failure within the network that can compromise the whole network. Second, each participant in MedCo cluster runs its own access management process. Also, there is no distributed immutable logging of queries received in MedCo. 

In this project, we aim to improve and fully implement ``MedChain: a distributed authorization system for medical queries" that overcomes the drawbacks present in MedCo. MedChain works seamlessly with MedCo and complements its workflow by handling the access management in a distributed manner. MedChain offers auditability as it records all the medical queries from the users in an immutable distributed ledger, i.e., the blockchain.
