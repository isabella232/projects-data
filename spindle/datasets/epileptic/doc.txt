The original dataset from the reference consists of 5 different folders, each with 100 files, with each file representing a single subject/person.
Each file is a recording of brain activity for 23.6 seconds. The corresponding time-series is sampled into 4097 data points.
Each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So we have total 500 individuals with each has 4097 data points for 23.5 seconds.
