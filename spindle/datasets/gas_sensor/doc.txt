This data set contains the acquired time series from 16 chemical sensors exposed to gas mixtures at varying concentration levels.
In particular, we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air, and Ethylene and CO in air.
Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption.
