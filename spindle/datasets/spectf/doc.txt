The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images.
Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal.
The database of 267 SPECT image sets (patients) was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images.
As a result, 44 continuous feature pattern was created for each patient. The CLIP3 algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns.
The CLIP3 algorithm generated rules that were 77.0% accurate (as compared with cardilogists' diagnoses).
